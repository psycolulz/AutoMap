What Is AutoMap?
=========================
AutoMap is an NMAP Cheat Sheet that teaches users the proper NMAP commands for specific tasks.


How To use AutoMap
===========================
As my two previous tools were made, this tool requires users to learn how to read and edit code as well
as learn the proper NMAP commands for certain tasks. Users will need to go into the code and edit the 
default example domains that I have set.

To do so type the following: nano AutoMap.sh

--script-args -f limit=50 www.example.com  <-- Change This Domain To Your Desired Domain On Each Line
